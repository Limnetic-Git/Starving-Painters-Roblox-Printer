Attention! Use the program at your own risk, the author does not guarantee that you will not be banned from roblox! 

You can change and distribute the code as you wish, but preferably with the author (me) indicated, because I am a genius.

THE CODE WILL MOST LIKELY NOT WORK ON WINDOWS, AS WELL AS LINUX WITH WAYLAND! I highly recommend using Xorg with the accompanying X libraries needed for pyautogui to work. You can try to write simulations of mouse movement and clicks on other libraries, if it works on Windows, write to me. To play roblox on Linux, I recommend Sober.
