Attention! Use the program at your own risk, the author does not guarantee that you will not be banned from roblox! 

You can change and distribute the code as you wish, but preferably with the author (me) indicated, because I am a genius.

THE CODE WILL MOST LIKELY NOT WORK ON WINDOWS, AS WELL AS LINUX WITH WAYLAND! I highly recommend using Xorg with the accompanying X libraries needed for pyautogui to work. You can try to write simulations of mouse movement and clicks on other libraries, if it works on Windows, write to me. To play roblox on Linux, I recommend Sober.

If you have any questions or suggestions, write to me on Telegram: @limneticgg

How to use it: in 110 lines of code in main.py specify the path to your 32x32 image, as well as the compression level of the image's color palette (the more, the fewer colors there will be in the final image), then launch the program and look at the preview. To print, press the space bar in the preview (1 TIME!)

If you have a misalignment of coordinates when printing, etc., etc., you can choose the coordinates of the buttons yourself (lines 8-15), but I did it for Full HD (sort of)
